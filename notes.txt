  gravity 1

grounded jump pressed
  gravity 0.3
  jump force

airborne jump held and not released since grounded and less than x time
  gravity 0.3
  
going up
  airborne jump pressed since grounded and more than or equal to x time
  or
  airborne jump released
  or
  airborne and jump pressed since release since airborne
    gravity 0.6

going down
  airborne velocity less than max
    gravity high
  airborne velocity more or equal to max
    gravity 0
    // down component of velocity should be max but omited for complexity
